## Early Check-In Request
**Question:** “Good afternoon, hope you’re well. I’m just checking if we can check in a bit earlier?”
**Answer:** We’ll email you the evening prior to your check-in day if early check-in is available.
**Notes:** If asked >24h out, set expectation that availability is confirmed the night before. If available, include any fee and earliest time.

## Late Check-Out Request
**Question:** “Good afternoon, hope you’re well. I’m just checking if we can check out a bit later?”
**Answer (no same‑day arrival):** Adding late checkout means we can’t offer that date to other guests, so we can’t provide complimentary late checkout. We can add an **extra night** to your booking so you can stay as late as you like on your check-out day (or stay the night). Please let us know if you’d like us to add this.
**Answer (yes same‑day arrival):** We’re very sorry but we can’t accept a later check-out as we have guests checking in on your departure day.
**Notes:** Check same‑day arrival in HomeHero before choosing the branch.

## Pets Update
**Question:** “Hello, it states on my reservation that there is only 2 guests. Just to clarify, we will be bringing our two dog also.”
**Answer:** Thanks for the update! We’ve noted that you’ll have one medium dog and one small dog with you. Everything looks good for your stay. If you have any other questions, just let us know.
**Notes:** Confirm property is pet‑friendly and include any pet rules/fees if applicable.

## Extra Guests & Charges
**Question:** “Please update that we have 8 coming (for 2 of the 3 nights) rather than 6.”
**Answer:** Thanks for the update! We can accommodate the additional guests. Adding 2 more guests brings the total to 8 and incurs an extra charge of **$20 per person**, plus booking fees.
**Notes:** Confirm max occupancy in HomeHero before confirming. Quote the correct fee if it differs per property.

## Why Was Our Booking Cancelled? (Airbnb)
**Question:** “Why was our booking cancelled?”
**Answer:** Because your reservation was made via Airbnb, **Airbnb’s cancellation policy applies**. Please contact Airbnb to check refund eligibility and details. If we can help you find alternative dates or properties, let us know.
**Notes:** If booking is direct or another channel, use internal policy instead.

## Check-In Instructions Not Received
**Question:** “I don’t appear to have received any check-in details for Booking ID XXXXX.”
**Answer:** You’ll receive your access instructions on the **day of check-in**. Please check your email and messages on the booking platform. Also ensure you’ve **signed the rental agreement**, which is required to receive access instructions.
**Notes:** Verify agreement status in HomeHero; if unsigned, send link/reminder.

## On-Stay Issue: Incorrect Wi‑Fi Details & Heater Power
**Scenario:** Guest at Piccolo Cottage reports Wi‑Fi SSID/password mismatch and limited heater outlets.
**Answer:** 
- Sorry for the confusion and inconvenience. 
- Please use the SSID/password on the fridge sticker (these are the most up-to-date details). If connection fails, switch the router off/on and restart your device. 
- We’re flagging this with the owner now so the guide is updated. 
- For the heater: if needed, we can supply a compliant extension lead. Let us know and we’ll arrange it.
**Notes:** Never email door codes. Create “Owner Update: Wi‑Fi details changed” task.
